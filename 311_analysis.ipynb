    "# Number of compiants per neighboorhood\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I used the Pittsburgh 311 dataset. The goal was to figure out which neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the “best” based on the number of complaints per neighborhood.\n",
    "My approach was simple. I looked at how many 311 complaints each neighborhood received in the past year and compared those numbers. To make it fair, I divided the number of complaints by the population of each neighborhood. This gave me a fair comparison, since larger neighborhoods naturally have more complaints.\n",
    "I also considered other ideas, like using total complaints (not fair to big neighborhoods) or weighting complaints by severity (too complex for this project). So I decided that complaints per 1,000 residents was the clearest and most balanced metric.\n"

    "The metric complaints per 1,000 residents measures how often people in each Pittsburgh neighborhood report issues through the city’s 311 system. It’s calculated by dividing the total number of 311 complaints by the neighborhood’s population and multiplying by 1,000. This shows which neighborhoods have fewer reported problems or stronger city services. The data comes from the 311 Service Requests dataset and City of Pittsburgh neighborhood population data."
