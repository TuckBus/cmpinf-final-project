    "### **Metric 3: Trees per Square Mile**\n",
    "The **number of trees** located in a neighborhood is a good metric for determining how *good* a neighborhood is. Neighborhoods with lots of trees will likely have more green space and more nature, making them much more **liveable**. Simply the *number* of trees, however, is not quite good enough. Of course, a larger neighborhood will have the opportunity to have more trees, so raw numbers is not an optimal metric. Instead, we can find the **trees per square mile** in each neighborhood. This is a much better metric because it is *proportional* to the size of the nieghborhood. To do this, we can count up the number of trees in each neighborhood using the **trees.csv** data file, and then divide by the square mileage of each neighborhood, found in the **demographics.csv** data file."
